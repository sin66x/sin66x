				<p class="content-header">** Early Days ** </p>
				<p>
				I was born in 1987 in South-West of Iran, in Ahvaz during the Iran-Iraq War. Well I have no memories of that because I was just two years old when they signed the peace treaty. <br/>
				I was the fourth (last child) of my familly. It has some nice consequences. I had always some role models and some one who could help me to grow up. I can remember those days when I was 7 or 8 years old and my brother taught me English. I remember those days we were TYPING codes from a German book (None of us khew German) into a Comodore-64 and foound out how to write codes in GW-Basic when I was just 9 years old - Of course I could not do that my self and I just follow my brother.<br/>
				</p>
				<p>
				Yes, I began to write codes when I was 9 but we had no reference or book but that damn German one. In those days  in Iran it was not common to have a computer in your home. My father was a kind of nerd and he loved technologies. He bought us one. It was really expensive for us. In 1995 we had that Comodore-64 and in 1998 a Pentium-I. It was really hard to find books about Computers in Ahvaz so we used to try and test every thing by ourselves. It's obvious that we wrecked the PC several times and re-install OS. It was nice because we learnt not to be scared of manipulating devices. I remember the first time we went to Tehran for a vacation and we visited Enqelab Square where we found several books about computers. We bought books about QBasic, Pascal, FoxPro and etc.! You cannot imagine how amazing it was for a 10 years old boy. I remember that I finished the QBasic book before we return home in Ahvaz.
				</p>
				<p>
				After compeleting elementary school, I have been accepted to study in NODET (National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents) schools. There we had a course about programming in C and Pascal. If you know about University Entrance Exams in Iran you would not be surprised that I didn't continue programming in High School. All we did in those days was preparing for that damn exam. Instead I fell in love with Physics! And I passed the first round to the Physics Olympiad, but not for next rounds...
				</p>
				
				<p class="content-header">** University ** </p>
				<p>
				In year 2005, Bsc. Of Computer Engineering in KN Toosi University in Tehran. I packed everything to move to Tehran and join my old love: Programming and Computers. It was amazing in first months but that was not really what I wished. I joined some other groups and activites specially political ones. I have been susspended for one year because I had protested to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_executions_of_Iranian_political_prisoners">1988 prison massacre</a> and beeing active in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_presidential_election_protests">2009 Iranian presidential election protests</a>!

				<p class="content-header">** Marriage and Professional Career ** </p>
				<p class="content-header-2">- Delta Global and VR Lab (2009 - 2012) </p>
				<p>
				I used that year (2009-2010) to find a job. I was lucky and I started my first professional job in <a href="https://deltaglobal.ir/">Delta Global</a> writing code in VHDL for Spartan-III and C/C++ with Qt. One year later, I got that freaking Bsc. Licence, and continue Working for Delta Global and Virtual Reality Labratory of KNToosi University of Technology. I became familiar with GNU/Linux and Free Software. Yes it was really late but I became a big fan soon.
				</p>
				<p class="content-header-2">- Marriage, A Big Lost and Mandatory Military Service (2012 - 2014) </p>
				<p>
				I married to my classmate, Sona, in this year when I was 25. after a few months I was forced to serve in Military for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Iran">mandatory military service</a> for 21-months. I don't want to remember anything about those days in Army. I don't want to talk about those days which we lost our beloved sister, Parastoo!
				</p>
				<p class="content-header-2">- Arghavan Birth and Infotech International (2014 - 2018) </p>
				<p>
				I started to work in Infotech Co. in 2014. Java was the main programming language there and the company was working in Banking Industry. I became master in Banking Solutions and Java in 4 years. our department has been seperated as a new company called: UniTech. I was the CTO of Unitech. It seemed that bad days are gone and I am going to have a good job and career. Sona and I decided to have a child, My daughter Arghavan!
				</p>
				<p>
				Because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions_against_Iran">sanctions against Islamic Republic Of Iran</a>, Infotech and Unitech became weak and they were not able to pay Salaries. I left my beloved company after 4 years for a good offer from Resalat Bank Of Iran.
				</p>
				<p class="content-header-2">- Resalat Bank Of Iran </p>
				<p>
				When I joined Resalat Bank, There was no Software Department. Most of softwares were out sourced just a few simple applications were written in the Bank by the Bussiness Intelligance team. I worked well there and soon became Manager of the BI Team and it became a department. we wrote applications, Maintaining Data Warehouse, Analyzing Data and etc. After a while a great project started: <a href="https://pishkhan.rqbank.ir">Pishkhan Majazy (Virtual Branch)</a>! we needed more concentration and more developers so We seperated BI and Software Departments and I became Software Department Manager and I am still working there.
				</p>
				<p class="content-header-2">- Remote Jobs </p>
				<p>
				I had some remote jobs during my career for RM Innovation (USA), Djuno Ltd (Switzerland) and some companies in Iran too.
